This section showcases how I apply <a href='https://github.com/marashot96/portfolio/blob/main/README.md'>mathematical methods</a> in analytics and business tasks.  
For those interested, I’ve also included a compact summary of key definitions and theorems from probability theory and mathematical statistics — a quick and accessible guide to this powerful mathematical toolkit.  
Math is beautiful :) You can download the summary <a href='https://github.com/marashot96/portfolio/blob/main/Math/Theory.pdf'>here</a>.

## 🔍 Navigation by Topics

Click each topic to explore how the mathematical problems were solved.

### 1. [Seminar Course: “Fundamentals of Statistics”](https://github.com/marashot96/Lections/blob/main/README.md)

A separate repository where I share materials from my teaching sessions on the “Fundamentals of Statistics” course.

### 2. [Statistical Problems in Product Analytics](/Math/Problems-PA.pdf)

This file includes solutions to various mathematical problems typically encountered when validating analytical conclusions in product analytics.

### 3. [Full Sample Analysis]()

I’m developing an MS Excel tool designed to conduct a full statistical analysis of a dataset of size *n*.  
This tool aims to support daily statistical tasks at the basic level.  
Anyone will be able to input a sample and specify the interval width for uniform binning, and obtain:

- Sample mean, variance, etc.  
- Hypothesis testing results and analytics (e.g. for banking products)  
- Power calculation of statistical tests

## 🧠 Relevance to Research

**PhD Thesis Title:** “Modeling of Probabilistic Processes and Statistical Characterization in Applied Problems”

**Practical Applications:**

- Bootstrap analysis for A/B testing with small samples  
- Bayesian methods under limited data conditions  
- Robust estimators for financial performance metrics
